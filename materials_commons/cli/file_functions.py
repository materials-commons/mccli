        A file is selected in a dataset's file selection if it is listed explicitly in "include_files". It is not selected if it is listed in "exclude_files". If it is neither explicitly included or excluded, its parent directories are searched up to the project root directory to see if they are included or excluded.

If the first parent directory listed is in "exclude_dirs", or if no parent directory is listed at all, the file is not selected.
